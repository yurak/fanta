      paragraph1: "In 2017, the project started among the Lviv fans of AC Milan as a classic fantasy football with one Serie A league for 5 players."
      paragraph2: "Since 2018, the Premier League has been launched according to the rules that have already been tested in practice, and 2 leagues for this tournament have appeared in the project. Since then, we have been expanding every year. Thus, in the 20/21 season, a tournament based on the Bundesliga started for the first time, and in the 21/22 season - La Liga and Ligue 1. In the 22/23 season, we add Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and the Championship to the list of available leagues."
      paragraph3: "In addition, according to slightly changed rules, we organize tournaments based on Champions League, European Championship and League of Nations. A tournament based on the World Cup in Qatar is planned."
      paragraph4: "In 2022, we still remain a project of like-minded people who have combined their professional skills (designers, marketers, developers, etc.) for the development of Ukrainian football fantasy."

      ul02: "We hold an auction where managers form their teams of 26 players. Each football player can be in the team of only one manager of the league - the one who paid the most for him. You can sell and buy new players to the team only in transfer windows."
      ul03: "All football players are divided into 11 unique positions in which they can perform (some players can play in several positions)."
      ul04: "Every round, the manager chooses the scheme for the game, the lineup of 11 main players and the bench (all schemes are balanced and usually include, in addition to the goalkeeper, 5 defensive and 5 attacking positions)."
      ul05: "The game takes place in the Head to Head system, that is, in each round you face one of the opposing managers."
      ul06: "The start of the Round (deadline for creating the lineup) is 1.5 hours before the first match of the tour (the round always coincides with the round of the calendar, if any match of the tour was not played due to postponement, then this round is not closed, but is waiting for completion). We do not have any 'paired' tours."
      ul07: "Based on the results of real matches, players are awarded not only bonuses and penalties for their actions, but also a Base rating. A third-party statistical resource assigns this rating to a player based on his actions in a real match. We use Fotmob as such a resource."
      ul08: "If the player did not play in the real Tour, he can be replaced by someone from the bench who can play in this position."
      ul09: "The basic scores of the main players, as well as maluses and bonuses, are added up and converted into game goals according to the principle: 72 points - 1 goal, each subsequent goal - for an additional 7 points."
      ul10: "The team that scored more goals in the match wins it. 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a draw. The tournament table is formed on the basis of these points."
      ul11: "The team with the most points at the end of the tournament wins the league and the trophy."

        note:
          ol1: "Before the auction, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the available game modules (schemes of the placement of players) and form the composition of your team taking into account the necessary positions."
          ol2: "Any pre-arrangements between multiple managers regarding the players they have selected and the price offered for them (before the results of the next round of the auction are revealed) are considered fair play and are strictly prohibited by the community."
          ol3: "During one transfer window, the manager cannot re-acquire a player he sold."
        paragraph1: "A live auction is a meeting of all league managers (more often online, less often offline) who bid for players in real time and with an open bid. On average, a live auction lasts 4 hours (such an auction takes place only at the request of all league managers and the administrator's consent)."
        paragraph2: "Each manager in turn names a football player for whom he is ready to pay at least 1 million from his budget. After that, the other managers can (but are not required to) make their bid. Each subsequent bet must be greater than the previous one by at least one step. The rate step is determined by the current rate. If the current rate is in the range from 1 to 19 - the minimum step is 1 million, in the range of 20-29 - 2 million, in the range of 30-39 - 3 million and so on. If no one has exceeded the current bet within 10 seconds, the player is considered sold."
        paragraph3: "The blind auction is the primary format used for team building because it does not require all managers to be online or offline at a pre-arranged time."
        paragraph4: "Additional auctions are provided to make changes to the composition of the teams, exclude injured players or those who lost their place in the team during the season."
        paragraph5: "Additional auctions, unlike the starting one, are held according to the following principle:"
        paragraph6: "At the first stage of the starting auction, some football players (about 50) have their minimum bet. These minimum bids apply ONLY at the first stage of the auction and are aimed at making the team composition more balanced."
        paragraph7: "Players will have a minimum price if they played 13+ matches last season in this league and were ranked in the top 5 players of the league in their position or had an average total score of 8.0+ last season."

        ul03: "Each manager, before the starting auction, receives a budget of 260 million to buy players."
        ul04: "Each team must consist of 26 players (of which at least 3 must be goalkeepers)."
        ul05: "Teams are formed from real players of the selected football championship."
        ul06: "Each player is unique and can only be represented by one team in the league."
        ul07: "There are no restrictions on the number of representatives of one football club in one team."
        ul08: "Incoming transfers outside the transfer windows are not provided."
        ul09: "There are two types of auction: blind (default) and live."
        ul11: "The blind auction takes place online directly on the MantraFootball website in several stages."
        ul12: "At the first stage, all managers have access to a list of all the players of the respective football championship."
        ul13: "Each manager needs to select 26 players (minimum 3 of which are goalkeepers) and divide their starting budget (260 million) between them."
        ul14: "The minimum bid is 1 million per selected player (except for the exceptions described below). The maximum bid is limited only by the total budget."
        ul15: "The bid is an integer multiple of 1 (where 1 means 1 million)."
        ul16: "Each stage of the auction ends when all managers in the league have confirmed their bids, or at a predetermined deadline, after which the system automatically compares the bids made by all managers."
        ul17: "The manager who placed the highest bid on a certain player takes him to his team, automatically reducing his budget by the amount of the bid placed on this player."
        ul18: "If the manager failed to purchase the player, the amount of the bid on him is returned to the budget."
        ul19: "If several managers have placed an equal bid on a certain player, and no one has exceeded this bid, such a player is considered unsold and remains available for purchase by any manager in the following stages of the auction (and the bids placed on him are returned)."
        ul20: "The stages of the auction are repeated until all managers have fully formed their teams of 26 players."
        ul21: "Until the end of the next round of the auction, managers should not know which players other managers have selected and what bids they have placed."
        ul31: "During the transfer window (after its announcement and before the deadline), the manager can select several players from his team to sell."
        ul32: "The amount that was previously paid by the manager for this player is returned to his budget, and the player himself becomes a free agent. Such a player will be available for purchase by any other league manager other than the one who sold him. The manager who sold the player will not be able to buy him until the next transfer window."
        ul33: "During the season, the transfer window opens 4 times. The exact schedule can be found in the 'Auctions' menu of the league after it is created. The approximate schedule is as follows: I – the first half of September, II – the second half of November, III – the first half of February, IV – the second half of March."
        ul34: "The number of players that can be sold in the top 5 tournaments (EPL, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, LaLiga): 3 players for each window in divisions A and B, for division C - 4 players, for divisions D and below - 5 players. For other tournaments, the number of slots in each auction is 5."
        ul35: "A player who left the championship (due to transfer, early termination of the contract, etc.) leaves the team on his own and the amount paid for him is returned to the manager's budget."
        ul36: "A player who has changed clubs within one tournament does not leave the Mantra team."
        ul37: "Additional auctions are always conducted in a blind format."
        ul38: "It is not possible to buy and sell players outside the transfer windows, except for one exception: if the team has only 1 goalkeeper left as a result of the transfer. In this case, another goalkeeper of the same club, whose goalkeeper remained in the squad, joins the team. After the opening of the transfer window, the manager will be able to sell this player according to the sales rules."

And vice versa: if a player finds himself in a module in a 'non-native' position, he can receive a clean sheet bonus, the size of which does not exceed the bonus of his 'native' position (for example, the size of the clean sheet bonus of a player with a 'native' DM position, who play at the CB position in the module, will be +0.5)."
          ol5: "When determining the author of a goal, assist, own goal, penalty kick, etc., the indicator of the FotMob service is taken into account, which should record and display the relevant fact. Indicators of other football portals and services are not taken into account."

        paragraph4: "The size of the bonus for a scored penalty does not depend on the position of the player."
        paragraph5: "Only the goalkeeper can get this bonus. The size of the bonus depends on the number of saves:"
        paragraph6: "The size of the clean sheet bonus depends on the player's position:"
        paragraph7: "To receive a bonus for clean sheet, a player must meet the following criteria at the same time:"
        paragraph8: "For a direct red card, the field player receives a minus -2, and the goalkeeper -3. Similarly, for removal due to two yellow cards."
        paragraph9: "However, if an outfield player who has already received a yellow card receives a direct red card, his malus will be -2.5 and for the goalkeeper -3.5."
        paragraph10: "Only the goalkeeper receives malus for missed goals, including penalties."
        paragraph11: "If certain players of the main team did not play in their match, and among the substitutes there is no player with a corresponding 'native' position, then he is replaced by a player of another position with the lowest malus (at first, a reserve player with a -1.5 malus is chosen, and in the absence of such a player - with a malus - 3)."

        paragraph5: "Since substitutions are affected by the order in which the players are on the bench (the higher the player, the higher priority he has), the best substitution option is the player with the smallest malus and the highest priority for making the necessary substitutions."
        paragraph6: "If there are several alternative options for substitutions with the same malus, caused solely by the order of substitutions, priority is given to the option for which the substitute with a higher position on the bench will take the place in the main squad."
        paragraph7: "In the absence of other reservations, substitutions are made from top to bottom - from goalkeepers to forwards."
        paragraph8: "The concept of substitutions does not allow substitution of players of the main squad among themselves. That is, if a player of the main team did not play, he can only be replaced by a player from the substitution list (and not another player of the main team who could play in this position)."
