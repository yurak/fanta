        paragraph1: "A live auction is a meeting of all league managers (often online, less often offline) who trade for players. On average, a live auction takes 4 hours. There is a blind auction format that takes much less time."
        paragraph2: "Each manager in turn names the player for whom he is ready to pay 1 million. After that, other managers can place their bids. Each subsequent bid must be at least one step higher than the previous one. The bid step is determined by the current bid. If the current bid is in the range from 1 to 19 - a minimum step is 1 million, in the range of 20-29 - 2 million, in the range of 30-39 - 3 million and so on. If no one exceeds the current bid within 15 seconds, the player is considered sold."
        paragraph3: "Because a live auction is time consuming, league participants can replace it with a blind one:"
        paragraph4: "All auctions, except the starting one, are held on the same principle: before the deadline, the manager must select the players he wants to sell in this transfer window. The amount paid by the manager for this player is returned to the account, and the player becomes a free agent (will be available to all teams except the one who sold it)."
        paragraph5: "The number of slots for sale varies: 5 for the winter auction and 3 for all others. Players who leave the tournament by transfer are counted outside the slots."
        paragraph6: "Additional auctions are held in a blind format."
        paragraph7: "It is not possible to buy / sell players outside the transfer windows."

        ul12: "The auction takes place in several stages. First, a complete list of league players is available to all league members within 24 hours. The manager needs to divide his budget (260 million) into 25 players from the list (2 of which are goalkeepers)."
        ul13: "Participants don't know to whom and what amounts their opponents bid. After the deadline, the bids of all managers on each player of the tournament are compared. The manager who has made the highest bid for a certain player - takes him to his team, and his budget is reduced by the amount of the bid."
        ul14: "If the highest bids are equal, the player is not sold, but remains available for the next stage."

Substitutions are also affected by the order in which the players are located on the bench (the higher the player - the higher his priority). Therefore, we are looking for an option with the smallest malus and the highest priority to make the necessary replacements."
